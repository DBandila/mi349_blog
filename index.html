            <p>Skyrim is a game known to many as THE open-world game. While playing, you will find yourself roaming Tamriel on a journey to your next quest, as indicated on your compass at the top of the screen. While traveling through the vast plains area, you listen to soothing travel music. Set to make the scenery that much more beautiful, the addition of music complements the world around it. Suddenly, the atmosphere shifts, and the music instantaneously changes, putting you into a panic. On your compass, a red dot appears on the right side of your map. As you turn to face the danger, you see a sabre cat and instantly slay the beast. One must assume that your character sensed it and brought its end swiftly. But in reality, it is due to the game&aposs alert system for players. Featured is one of the most recognizable combat music in video games. But what makes Skyrim&aposs combat music stand out?

            <p>The developers at Bethesda use two approaches to confirm that the players are informed. One of them was the compass shown above. It gives the player every bit of information that they would ever need in that bar. The second, however, is a little more subtle. The combat music in Skyrim acts as an alert system. It tells the player “there is danger around”, and the first place they will look after hearing it should be the compass.

            <h3>The Relationship Between Audio and Reaction Time.</h3>

            <p>Audio in games is both fashionable and functional. Most of the time, it is used in order to inform the player. With multiple uses of an audio cue, the player can deduce what to do next much faster. A recent study attempted to relate how reaction time is affected when the participants are given an audio cue for the human benchmark. What is the human benchmark?

            <p>The Human Benchmark is an online test that checks the visual reaction time. This is done by having participants click the screen, turning it red. Then they must wait until the screen becomes green, and they must click again to measure how fast or slow they took. The website will then compare the results to the average time of 273 milliseconds to see if the score was faster or slower. There is also a disclaimer that, since it is an online resource, latency with the monitors may affect the scores. In this study, the researchers used the Human Benchmark while adding an audio cue at the same time. This would occur at the same moment that the screen would turn green. This would help researchers see if it would increase the speed at which the participants reacted. The results are in the table below.</p>
